## Introduction
In this research article, I’ll talk about progression systems, specifically, what is a progression system and the most common types that we can find. I will analyze the math behind these structures like progression curves and some formulas to create basic progression curves will be also included. And I’ll include some important game designs concepts which are useful to take it as a reference when creating a new one.

### Progression systems
What is the objective of a good progression system?
 
- Essentially, a good RPG progression system objective is to make the player not detect the infinite game loop that every game has.
- Avoid the feeling of repetition of the same action over and over again while the player is playing.
- Provide the player with a good and long-term decision making system, which let him take decisions for future sessions of playing.
- Having a good game progression means having a balanced progression, if we are not able to achieve this, our player will be frustrated due to it.

### How does a bad progression system look like?

- We will find that the player feels that he is repeating the process over and over again without finding any motivation to keep playing, he gets bored so fast.
- We find skinner boxes, the game loop is boring and repetitive, the game bases its loop in repeating actions and rewarding randomly the player when he does an especific action.
- A clear example of good progression system lack are games that abuse of 'grinding'. It is something that is not bad to do sometimes but, if the game progression is based on that, the game will be so repetitive and boring for the player.

### What does progression apport?
Progression apports the player the feeling that he is overcoming the obstacles he finds during his game sessions. This allows him to feel ready too for the new ones that will come in the future.

To achieve this we have to meet three conditions:

- Clear goals: the player has to be sure of what are his next steps and what he wants to achieve.
- Immediate and constant feedback.
- Balance between the perceived challenge and the perceived level of skill needed; the player has te be aware of what skill he has every moment, he has to be able to detect what challenges he can pass and what challenges he cannot pass.

If we meet these three conditions our player will feel that he has our game under control, something that allow us to keep him playing and satisfied.

### What is a progression system and why is it important?

A progression system is a combination of mechanics which forces the player to make actions with determined goals, and these must complete them in order to move forward. The player will be able to carry out activities during the whole game and along the way, he might be able to unlock new content and new knowledge to learn (new abilities, more quest, etc).
When a player plays a game and does not feel any progression, he can feel frustrated and that can bring him to leave the game.
Our objective when we make a game is to make our player enjoy when he is playing. If we achieve this, the player will remain loyal to our product. If our progression system is good enough, this will be much easier.
 
In order to success in having a good progression system, there are some key element to take into account, which are:

- Great mechanics which makes the player feel satisfaction when interacting with the different elements of your game such as weapons and  abilities. In order to do this you could use what is called mechanics progression, which is a way to control the way the player learns the different elements of the game over time, there are two types of mechanics progression:
-- Some mechanics are unavailable at first and will be introduced progressively when playing the game


-- All the mechanics are introduced at first but developers use the gameplay in order to induce them. An example of games which have this system will be the games developed by FromSoftware (Dark souls saga and bloodborne)



- As a developer, you want to have as most control as possible on how much time the player might be taken when leveling up, completing a quest, stage,… And use it in  order to improve the experience and balancing matters, player can’t spend  unnecessary time in a mission or trying to level up, because this can drive the player to frustration.

- If you have any type of progression system you need to reward the players that go through them, and this reward are essential in order to make the player feel that he/she is progressing, like game modes, upgrades, unlockable content, in general, new content.
- The secondary reward are those ones that satisfy our visual and aural stimulus, in other words, good visual and auditive effects which focus the player's attention and of course, improve the experience, e.g. when playing FPS (First Person Shooters) if you kill an enemy with a headshot a sound will play, this sound is a reward which gives positive feedback to the player and gives a satisfactory stimulus too.


- Understanding the elements that affect your games difficulty, are key in order to provide a good experience, damage dealt by enemies, weapons stats, etc. This is the main elements to take into account when creating a progression system, there are more specific elements and strategies to use to improve a progression system.

### Why do they work?

Nowadays most of the new games have a progression system, and not only from RPG game which are the ones from the progression system are born (Original D&D), most genres have implemented these systems, and currently, it seems difficult for a game to work without them. But why do these systems are so popular?

The reason is that is useful for the players and the developers, it's good for the player because it gives them the feeling of getting stronger, giving them a sense of progression and that the time they spend in the games is worth the time.

And for the developer's progressions systems helps them to control the flow of the game, to balance it and modify it as they want (e.g. levels and experience point good tools for that ). In that way, developers are more accurate in creating a better experience, and better control in the player's actions.

# What makes a great progression system?

To make a good progression system not based on grinding we can take some elements that can help us to make the player unaware of the game loops and repetitions.

- Mistery: people are very curious, if we can make our player ask himself questions like, why is this happening? how do I do that? What happens if I do this? will mean that he is enjoying the game and means that he wants to keep playing to be able to answer those questions.

- Mastery: we can make the player progress by giving him something to master, like an ability and then, reward him with the use of it.

- Mental Challenge: stimulate the player to make him try to find out how can he get an objective is a good way to keep him interested in our game.

- Narrative: if the story is good enough to make the player think, 'wow, I would like to be there',you have already won a lot of points to make him enjoy the game.

- Novelty: players and people in general, like novel things, different things. This aspect is a bit delusive because if something is not done yet it is probably because it will not work. Anyway there are plenty of examples that went well.New content: it is important to give the players new content, this brings them the desire of wanting to try the content and keep playing.

- FLOW: if we make a good mix of these elements we will achieve the goal of every video game, make the player enter to the flow state.

# Types of progression systems

### Level based progression:

By doing some determined actions player gain XP/EXP (experience) point which allows them to level up, so the player abilities get stronger and also increases the quantity of XP the player needs to get to the next level (threshold) and the level the player currently has, represent his/her skills/experience.

### Training/Play-Style progression:

This system increases the attributes power the more that is used and is not driven by XP, the more distance you run the more stamina, the more kill with one-handed weapons the more strength and abilities with those… A good example of this kind of system implemented in a game could be The Elder Scrolls v: Skyrim.


### Skill points progression:

In this system, player improve their skills by allocating points and usually, they are able to spend it as they please which gives to the player more control over the characters growth, e.g 3 points to improve dexterity, 10 to improve archery, etc.


Currently, most of the game doesn't only have one of these systems but multiple at the same time with slight changes in each one in order to work, as some of the last examples shown.You could have a leveling up system that instead of increasing your abilities/ attributes when the player levels up, grants you a certain number of skill points which will allow you to purchase new abilities or improve the ones the player already has.

# Mathematics in RPG Progression

As we all know, almost every progression system is based on XP, or levels which normally are mesured by XP aswell.

This XP is nothing more than numbers, every game has its own system of formulas to calcule the amount of XP a character need to level up.

I provide you a generic formula which can be used in a RPG game for your own XP system:

points_required_to_level_up=(15level)+(9(level-1))

This is a general formula but, like I said, every game has its own sytem and there are infinite types of formulas which help teams calcule the amount of XP they need to level up, to calcule the damage at each level, the life, etc.

Some examples are AAA games, they use so complex mathematics formulas to calcule their stats along the progression of the player during the game.

These are examples of XP formulas:
- RuneScape:

- World of Warcraft:

- Diablo III:

# Balancing issues

Have you ever heard: this game is perfectly balanced!! No. Me neither. Balancing a game, specially a RPG, which usually have so many abilities, skills, types of enemies, etc., is so difficult.

It is so easy to find an over-powered ability or play that wins you a battle whithout much skill. This is something that we do not want for our game. Make a perfectly balanced game is almost impossible, but can still get as closer as possible to do not make our great game a bad game just because the numbers are not balanced.
In order to prevent this we have to make a strong designing process in our preproduction phase. The stronger our basis is, the easier we will balance the game.
Even though we make a very consistent preproduction phase, we will struggle for sure balancing our game. We only have one way to make sure everything is balanced: testing.
We have to test our game as much as we can to know what can be changed to balance more the game and take it to the point we want.

When we know what do we want to change, we enter in the game tunning phase, it is were normally, our designers change the stats numbers or formulas in order to balance the game and bring it to our aim point.
